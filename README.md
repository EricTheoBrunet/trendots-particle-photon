### [Trendots](https://www.trendots.com) connector and sample code for [Particle](https://www.particle.io) - [Photon](https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/photon-wifi-dev-kit)

In this project I am sharing sample code to connect a Partle Photon Arduino device to Trendots. This sample code can be used as a startup project, all you need to do is build your hardware tweak this code and have fun doing it!
