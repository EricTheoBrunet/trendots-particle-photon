## Got a question or problem?

Firstly, please go over our Wiki page: https://github.com/pico7/trendots-particle-photon/wiki

Please, do not open issues for the general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/trendots-particle-photon) where maintainers are looking at questions tagged with `trendots-particle-photon`.

StackOverflow is a much better place to ask questions since:
* there are hundreds of people willing to help on StackOverflow
* questions and answers stay available for public viewing so your question / answer might help someone else
* SO voting system assures that the best answers are prominently visible.

To save your and our time we will be systematically closing all the issues that are requests for general support and redirecting people to StackOverflow.

## You think you've found a bug?

We will be insisting on a minimal reproduce scenario in order to save maintainers time and ultimately be able to fix more bugs. Interestingly, from our experience users often find coding problems themselves while preparing a minimal plunk. We understand that sometimes it might be hard to extract essentials bits of code from a larger code-base but we really need to isolate the problem before we can fix it.

Unfortunately we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduce scenario.


## You want to contribute some code?

We are always looking for the quality contributions and will be happy to accept your Pull Requests as long as those adhere to some basic rules:

* Please assure that you are submitting quality code.
